<!-- I am an MRes (Master of Research) student in Machine Learning at Imperial College London, supervised by [**Dr. Matthieu Komorowski**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthieukomorowski/) and [**Dr. Guang Yang**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gyangmedia/). I obtained my B.Sci. degree in Statistic with a minor in Computing from The University of Melbourne and an Honours degree in Data Science from The University of Sydney.


- My current research focuses on applying advanced AI techniques, including:
  - **GANs** and **Diffusion Generative models**, to **medical imaging**.
  - **Medical data Synthesis** 
  -  **CXR image translation and Computer-aid Medical Image Analysis**.

**I am actively seeking PhD and RA opportunities.**

Feel free to contact me for Chat and Research Opportunities.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
