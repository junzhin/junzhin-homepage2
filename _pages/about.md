I am an MRes (Master of Research) student in Machine Learning at Imperial College London, supervised by [**Dr. Matthieu Komorowski**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthieukomorowski/) and [**Dr. Guang Yang**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gyangmedia/). I obtained my B.Sci. degree in Statistic with a minor in Computing from The University of Melbourne and an Honours degree in Data Science from The University of Sydney.


- My current research focuses on applying advanced AI techniques, including:
  - **GANs** and **Diffusion Generative models**, to **medical imaging**.
  - **Medical data Synthesis** 
  -  **CXR image translation and Computer-aid Medical Image Analysis**.

**I am actively seeking PhD and RA opportunities.**

Feel free to contact me for Chat and Research Opportunities.
