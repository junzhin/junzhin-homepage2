My research primarily aims to enable effective, robust, and interpretable Large Language Models (LLMs) for reasoning, understanding, and analysis on human language. In addition to LLMs, I am also passionate about building LLM-based real-world Autonomous Agents that are rigorous, tractable, and interactive.
